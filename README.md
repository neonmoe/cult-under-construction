# Cult Under Construction
Cult Under Construction is an entry to Ludum Dare 43, and the name was inspired by the fact that I did not have any good ideas for games. So I just made an fps that's mechanically sound, and thoughtstreamed the content, straight from my brain. This led into some plans which did not get finished, hence "under construction."

It’s a first-person adventure game with no real aim, so don’t worry about “finishing” the game. You can close it out by pressing escape.

### Controls
- Left-click to grab an item, throw it away, and open doors
- Right-click to put an item in your inventory
- I to invert the mouse on the Y-axis. (Pardon the lack of a proper menu, I just forgot until it was too late.)
- Esc to close the game.
